#Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

#A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing 
#the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_length = 0
        for i in t:
            if s_length < len(s):
                if i == s[s_length]:
                    s_length += 1
        if s_length == len(s):
            return True
        else:
            return False
            
#Instead of if/else statement at end get used to "return: s_length==len(s)" this will return True or False based on condition
